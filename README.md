## My Travels Project
# Project Overview

Welcome to the My Travels project! This project showcases a web page that displays my travel destinations with beautiful background images. It provides an interactive user experience where clicking on different travel destinations expands the view, revealing more details. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I completed it in a few hours while I searched for Javascript tutorials on how to code the expanding images.
